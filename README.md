### 🧠 About Me  

I'm **Madhu Nadh Gurram**, an **Information Technology Graduate (2024)** and a passionate **DevOps and Cloud Engineer** in the making.
My interest in DevOps started with curiosity — learning how automation connects development and operations. Since then, I’ve been exploring and working with tools like **Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, and AWS** to build complete automation workflows and improve deployment efficiency.


I believe the best way to learn is by building things. My projects show this — from simple website hosting to complete CI/CD pipelines.

> 💡 My motto: "Build it. Automate it. Keep improving."
